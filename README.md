# dbus-solax-x-pvinverter
Get production values from Solax Modbus or Solax Cloud for X1/X3 inverters and feed them into [Victron Energies Venus OS](https://github.com/victronenergy/venus) DBus to make same available on CCGX and VRM portal


## Purpose
I wanted to get a least some values from my PV inverter into the VRM portal.
Even if the **limitation of this setup** is, that values on Solax Cloud are only updated every 5 minutes.
Solax X1 inverter offer ModBus support, but I am not that deep into it, so lets go for the cloud/RESTapi way ;-)


## Inspiration
This project is one of my first projects on GitHub and with Victron components as well as in Python.
So for this one here I cook basicaly the code from my [Shelly 3EM Smartmeter into DBus integration](https://github.com/fabian-lauer/dbus-shelly-3em-smartmeter/).


## How it works
### Possible setup
- Shelly 3EM with latest firmware (20220209-094824/v1.11.8-g8c7bb8d)
  - 3-Phase installation (normal for Germany)
  - Connected to Wifi netowrk "A"
  - IP 192.168.2.108/24  
- Victron Energy Cerbo GX with Venus OS - Firmware v2.84
  - Connected to Wifi netowrk "A"
  - IP 192.168.2.110/24
- Victron MultiPlus II 48/3000
- Solax X1 Boost 5.0 DT
  - 5kW
  - Wifi Stick
  - Solax Cloud account with API credentials



### Details / Process
As mentioned above the script is inspired by @RalfZim fronius smartmeter implementation.
So what is the script doing:
- Running as a service
- connecting to DBus of the Venus OS `com.victronenergy.pvinverter.pv_[SERIAL-OF-INVERTER]`
- After successful DBus connection Solax Cloud is accessed via REST-API and a JSON is returned with all details  
- Serial/MAC is taken from the response as device serial
- Paths are added to the DBus with default value 0 - including some settings like name, etc
- After that a "loop" is started which pulls data every xxx ms from the REST-API and updates the values in the DBus

Thats it üòÑ

## Install & Configuration
### Get the code
Just grap a copy of the main branche and copy them to `/data/dbus-solax-x1-pvinverter`.
After that call the install.sh script.

The following script should do everything for you:
```
pip install solax-x3-rs485
wget https://github.com/fabian-lauer/dbus-solax-x1-pvinverter/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
unzip main.zip "dbus-solax-x1-pvinverter-main/*" -d /data
mv /data/dbus-solax-x1-pvinverter-main /data/dbus-solax-x1-pvinverter
chmod a+x /data/dbus-solax-x1-pvinverter/install.sh
/data/dbus-solax-x1-pvinverter/install.sh
rm main.zip
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Check configuration after that - because service is already installed an running and with wrong connection data (host, username, pwd) you will spam the log-file


### Change config.ini
Within the project there is a file `/data/dbus-solax-x1-pvinverter/config.ini` - just change the values

If you add MODBUS to your config the SOLAXCLOUD settings will be ignored.

To use with only one phase (X1 devices) just remove Phase2 and Phase3 from the INVERTER.PHASES section.

| Section  | Config vlaue | Explanation |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| APP  | SignOfLifeLog  | Time in minutes how often a status is added to the log-file `current.log` with log-level INFO |
| MODBUS | port | The port of the modbus adapter to use ie. /dev/ttyUSB0 |
| MODBUS | unit | The modbus unit id, if multiple units share the same modbus, default = 1 |
| SOLAXCLOUD  | Endpoint | API endpoint - should always be the same |
| SOLAXCLOUD  | TokenId | TokenId from Solax Cloud portal |
| SOLAXCLOUD  | RegNo | RegNo of inverter WifiStick |
| INVERTER  | Position | Refer to Victron documentation - 0=AC input 1; 1=AC output; 2=AC input 2 |
| INVERTER  | MaxPower | Inverter max AC power in watts |
| INVERTER  | GridVoltage | The voltage is not returned by RESTapi so we use this value to calculate the current based on power |
| INVERTER  | Phase | Phase your inverter is connected to |
| INVERTER.PHASES | Phase1 | Name of Phase 1, ie. L1 |
| INVERTER.PHASES | Phase2 | Name of Phase 2, ie. L2 |
| INVERTER.PHASES | Phase3 | Name of Phase 3, ie. L3 |
